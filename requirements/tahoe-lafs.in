# This file is meant to be generated by `tox -e update-github-repo`. However, we need to depend on colorama.
# I have https://github.com/PrivateStorageio/ZKAPAuthorizer/pull/253 open to add that to zkapauthorizer.
# However, instead of pinning to a PR version, I just add that here manually. Hopefully that PR will be
# merged before this file needs to be update, in which case the regenerating this file will remove the
# colorama dependency here and just work.
