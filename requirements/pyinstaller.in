# PyInstaller version 6.0.0 places non-executable/resource files in a
# different location than prior versions (specifically, under under a
# new "_internal" subdirectory). To avoid the overhead of having to
# search both paths at runtime, assume/support only the newer one.
# See https://pyinstaller.org/en/v6.0.0/CHANGES.html#features
pyinstaller >= 6.0.0
